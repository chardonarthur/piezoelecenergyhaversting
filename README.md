# Energy Harvesting Project

## Project Overview

This project, named led by Henri Baudry and Arthur Chardon, focuses on the recovery of energy through vibrating piezoelectric devices.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:

1. **Characterize Piezoelectric Material Behavior:** Understand and analyze the behavior of a piezoelectric material to harness its potential for energy harvesting.

2. **Optimize Vibrational Energy Recovery:** Explore and implement strategies to optimize the recovery of vibrational energy from objects such as machines and turbines, utilizing piezoelectric converters.

## Key Features

- **Material Characterization:** In-depth study and analysis of the characteristics of the chosen piezoelectric material.

- **Energy Recovery Optimization:** Development and implementation of techniques to maximize the efficiency of energy recovery from vibrating objects.

## Team Members

- Henri Baudry
- Arthur Chardon
